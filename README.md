# 📝 To-Do List Website

This is my first web development project—a simple **To-Do List** application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The app allows users to manage their tasks efficiently, with features for creating, updating, and deleting tasks. All data is stored in **localStorage**, making it persistent even after refreshing the page.

## 🌟 Features
- **Add "Works"**: Create sections for different categories of tasks.
- **Manage Tasks**: Each section includes:
  - Task input and display fields.
  - Options to **check off**, **update**, and **delete** tasks.
- **LocalStorage Support**: Data, including works, tasks, and their completion status, is saved locally on the user's browser.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on desktop and mobile devices.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic functionality.
- **localStorage**: For data persistence.
